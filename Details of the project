Collaborated on a 3-member team to design and develop a quadruped robot prototype, equipped with 3R manipulators on each leg, as a proof-of-concept for a home surveillance robot.
Utilized Python and Arduino IDE to implement inverse and forward kinematics, enabling the robot to navigate and interact with its environment.
The robot is designed to detect and respond to critical events in the home, such as:
Fall detection: alerting the head of the household if an elderly person or child falls down.
Intruder detection: notifying the head of the household if an unauthorized person enters the home.
The robot will report these events in real-time, providing an added layer of safety and security for families.
